# my_little_AI
Simple algorithm which tries its best to find a way to goal.

Run 'Simulation_App.py' to open a simulation app.
You can choose the level (from 0 to 4) and amount of dots (from 100 to 10_000) for simulation.
It takes time to find a way, especially for hard levels, but it will be 30 Gen's for 4th level, be patient.

All logs during the simulation will be saved in 'session_logs.txt' to see trough your actions.
